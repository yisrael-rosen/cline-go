# Current System Analysis and TDD Improvement Proposals

## Current System Analysis

### System Prompt Structure Analysis

The current system prompt has several sections that touch on TDD, but the implementation guidance isn't strongly enforced:

1. **In OBJECTIVE Section**
   - Currently focuses on task breakdown and tool usage
   - No explicit mention of writing tests first
   - Jumps directly to implementation after analysis

2. **In DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS Section**
   ```
   ## Test-Driven Development:
   1. Write tests first following TDD principles
   2. Verify changes don't break existing functionality
   3. Consider edge cases and error handling
   4. Add appropriate error messages and logging
   5. Follow project's existing patterns
   ```
   While TDD is mentioned, it's just one subsection among many and lacks enforcement mechanisms.

3. **In VALIDATION FRAMEWORK Section**
   ```
   ## Before Any Code Changes:
   1. Use search_files to find related code and understand context
   2. Use find_references to check all usages of functions/variables
   3. Use list_code_definition_names to understand overall structure
   4. Read relevant test files to understand expected behavior
   ```
   Test files are only mentioned for reading, not for writing new tests.

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Weak Test-First Enforcement**
   - No explicit requirement to write tests before implementation
   - No validation mechanism to ensure tests exist
   - No tooling specifically designed for test-first development

2. **Workflow Issues**
   - The OBJECTIVE section encourages immediate tool usage for implementation
   - No clear separation between test writing and implementation phases
   - No explicit red-green-refactor cycle guidance

3. **Missing Test-First Tools**
   - No specialized tools for test creation and validation
   - No mechanism to verify test existence before implementation
   - No way to enforce the TDD cycle

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced OBJECTIVE Section

Replace the current objective with a more TDD-focused version:

```
OBJECTIVE

You accomplish tasks following strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. ANALYZE
   - Break down the task into testable units
   - Define expected behavior for each unit
   - Plan test cases before any implementation

2. RED PHASE
   - Write a failing test for the current unit
   - Verify the test fails for the expected reason
   - Get user confirmation before proceeding

3. GREEN PHASE
   - Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - Run tests to confirm success
   - No refactoring at this stage

4. REFACTOR PHASE
   - Clean up the implementation
   - Maintain test passing status
   - Consider design improvements

5. REPEAT
   - Move to next unit of work
   - Start again from RED phase
   - Maintain strict test-first discipline

Each phase must be completed and confirmed before moving to the next.
DO NOT proceed to implementation without a failing test.
```

### 2. New Test-First Tools

Add new tools specifically for TDD:

```typescript
## verify_test_exists
Description: Verify that a test file exists for the target implementation file
Parameters:
- implementation_path: (required) Path to the implementation file
- test_pattern: (optional) Custom test file naming pattern

## create_test
Description: Create a new test file with proper structure
Parameters:
- implementation_path: (required) Path to the implementation file
- test_cases: (required) Array of test cases to implement

## run_focused_test
Description: Run specific test(s) during TDD cycle
Parameters:
- test_path: (required) Path to test file
- test_name: (required) Name of specific test to run
```

### 3. Enhanced Validation Framework

Add explicit test-first validation:

```typescript
## Before ANY Implementation:
1. Verify test file exists
2. Ensure test covers new functionality
3. Confirm test is failing (RED phase)
4. Get user confirmation to proceed

## Before ANY Refactoring:
1. Verify all tests are passing
2. Document current test coverage
3. Plan refactoring steps
```

### 4. Implementation Strategy

1. **Modify System Prompt Generation**
   - Update OBJECTIVE section for stronger TDD focus
   - Add test-first validation requirements
   - Include new TDD-specific tools

2. **Add Test Verification Layer**
   ```typescript
   const TEST_VERIFICATION = {
     beforeImplementation: async (path) => {
       const testExists = await verifyTestFile(path);
       const testsFailing = await runTests(path);
       return testExists && testsFailing;
     },
     afterImplementation: async (path) => {
       return await runTests(path);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Enhance Tool Framework**
   ```typescript
   const TOOL_PREREQUISITES = {
     'write_to_file': ['verify_test_exists'],
     'edit_code_symbols': ['verify_test_exists'],
     'edit_go_symbols': ['verify_test_exists']
   };
   ```

### Expected Benefits

1. **Stronger TDD Compliance**
   - Enforced test-first development
   - Clear phase separation
   - Better test coverage

2. **Improved Code Quality**
   - Better design through test-first approach
   - More maintainable code
   - Clearer feature specifications

3. **Better Learning**
   - Reinforces TDD principles
   - Provides clear workflow
   - Builds good habits

## Implementation Priority

1. Update OBJECTIVE section for TDD focus
2. Add test verification tools
3. Implement test-first validation
4. Enhance tool framework
5. Add workflow enforcement
6. Update documentation

This revised approach should help shift the system's behavior toward strict TDD practices while maintaining its existing capabilities.
