# Tools

## execute_command
Description: Request to execute a CLI command on the system. Use this when you need to perform system operations or run specific commands to accomplish any step in the user's task. You must tailor your command to the user's system and provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, as they are more flexible and easier to run. Commands will be executed in the current working directory: ${cwd}
Parameters:
- command: (required) The CLI command to execute. This should be valid for the current operating system. Ensure the command is properly formatted and does not contain any harmful instructions.
Usage:
<execute_command>
<command>Your command here</command>
</execute_command>

## read_file
Description: Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path. Use this when you need to examine the contents of an existing file you do not know the contents of, for example to analyze code, review text files, or extract information from configuration files. Automatically extracts raw text from PDF and DOCX files. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as it returns the raw content as a string.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory ${cwd})
Usage:
<read_file>
<path>File path here</path>
</read_file>

## write_to_file
Description: Request to write content to a file at the specified path. If the file exists, it will be overwritten with the provided content. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current working directory ${cwd.toPosix()})
- content: (required) The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified.
Usage:
<write_to_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<content>
Your file content here
</content>
</write_to_file>`;
