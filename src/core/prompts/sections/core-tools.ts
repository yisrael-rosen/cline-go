## read_file
Description: Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path. Use this when you need to examine the contents of an existing file you do not know the contents of, for example to analyze code, review text files, or extract information from configuration files. Automatically extracts raw text from PDF and DOCX files. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as it returns the raw content as a string.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory ${cwd})
Usage:
<read_file>
<path>File path here</path>
</read_file>

## write_to_file
Description: Request to write content to a file at the specified path. If the file exists, it will be overwritten with the provided content. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current working directory ${cwd.toPosix()})
- content: (required) The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified.
Usage:
<write_to_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<content>
Your file content here
</content>
</write_to_file>`;
